These are blockchain domains, more seizure and censor proof and one fee. A few projects here;  [Bhandshake](https://bhandshake.vercel.app), [AncientManuscripts](https://beechains.github.io/ancientmanuscripts.github.io/), and [Bmindful](https://beechains.github.io/bmindful.github.io). Big thanks to [Handshake](https://handshake.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). [this is the Handshake project and logo pictured below](https://handshake.org)

We call this a bhandshake domain!

## Getting Started; We edit everything to our liking and build the web page from the code up. Happy BDay BRO!!! 

This is a Domain:

It can say what ever you like.

Open [bcrypto8](https://bcrypto8.vercel.app) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
